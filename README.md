## üßæ Abstract
As the global gaming market continues to soar, reaching an estimated worth of over $300 billion by 2027, the quest for the next blockbuster game intensifies among major publishers. This project delves into the realm of video game analysis, scrutinizing critic and user scores alongside sales data for the top 400 video games spanning from 1977 to the present day. Through meticulous examination, the project seeks to uncover patterns that may indicate a golden age of gaming and shed light on the evolving landscape of the industry. Employing techniques such as data joining, set theory comparisons, filtering, grouping, and ordering, this endeavor offers insights into the trajectory of video games and the underlying factors influencing their success. While the dataset provided for this project is limited to 400 entries, the broader gaming community dataset with over 13,000 games on Kaggle serves as a rich resource for further exploration and analysis.


The solution and analysis is available in the [Solution](Solution.md) file.
